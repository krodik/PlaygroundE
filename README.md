# PlaygroundE

PlaygroudE is a multi-player game that has a combat system and a control system like the game Magica. 
Players use combinations of elements to cast spell. However, players are put into an arena like PlayerUnknownâ€™s BattleGround. 
The arena will get smaller over the game time. The last survivor will win. We will use Unity for game development.
